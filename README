Vimfiles
========

My current vimfiles. Plugins are managed with Vundle.

This is not intended as a distribution, as I may change it depending
on the work I'm doing. And I only use it under Linux.

But you are welcome to use my .vimrc to create your own. I've tried to
keep .vimrc commented and keep my tweaks not-breaking the vim-way of
doing things.

My *old* (unmaintained) vimfiles: https://github.com/gaveen/gavim


How to setup
------------
1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
    $ git clone https://github.com/gaveen/vimfiles.git
2. Link the cloned .vim and .vimrc to home directory
    e.g., assuming the cloned repo is in ~/Apps/
          $ ln -s ~/Apps/vimfiles/.vim ~/.vim
          $ ln -s ~/Apps/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
3. Launch vim and in normal mode, run :PluginInstall

4. To update plugins when needed, run :PluginUpdate


Quick setup
-----------
Alternatively, you can download: http://is.gd/gaveen_vimfiles

If you can't use the earlier method, get above archive (.tar.xz format),
extract, and follow only the above step 2.


Requirements
------------
- vim and/or gvim (version 7.3 or higher)
    Package: Fedora family => vim-enhanced / vim-X11,
             Debian family => vim / vim-gnome
- git (not-needed for quick setup, needed for updating)
    Package: Fedora family => git, Debian family => git-core
- Internet connectivity to fetch the plugins and updates


Optional
--------
- ack - a better grep alternative if you plan to use :Ack
    Package: Fedora family => ack, Debian family => ack-grep
    if you use a Debian family OS, uncomment necessary line in vimrc
- exuberant ctags - to use the tagbar feature
    Package: Fedora family => ctags, Debian family => exuberant-ctags
- wmctrl - if you want to use gvim in a full screen mode
    Package: Fedora family => wmctrl, Debian family => wmctrl
    if your window manager supports this, uncomment necessary lines
- vim-latex - Vim LaTeX Suite plugin to use vim as a LaTeX/TeX IDE
    Package: Fedora family => vim-latex, Debian => vim-latexsuite
