Vimfiles
========

My current vimfiles. Plugins are managed with Vundle.

This is not intended as a distribution, as I may change it depending
on the work I'm doing. And I only use it under Linux.

But you are welcome to use my .vimrc to create your own. I've tried to
keep .vimrc commented and keep my tweaks not-breaking the vim-way of
doing things.

My *old* (unmaintained) vimfiles: https://github.com/gaveen/gavim


How to setup
------------
1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
    $ git clone https://github.com/gaveen/vimfiles.git
2. Update submodules (to fetch Vundle)
    $ cd vimfiles/
    $ git submodule update --init
3. Link the cloned .vim and .vimrc to home directory
    e.g., assuming the cloned repo is ~/Apps/vimfiles
          $ ln -s ~/Apps/vimfiles/.vim ~/.vim
          $ ln -s ~/Apps/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
4. Launch vim, and in normal mode, enter :PluginInstall

5. To update plugins when needed, run :PluginUpdate


Quick setup
-----------
Alternatively, you can download: http://is.gd/gaveen_vimfiles

extract, and follow only the above step 3.
