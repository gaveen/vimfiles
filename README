Vimfiles
========

My current vimfiles. Plugins are managed with vim-plug.

This is not intended as a distribution, as I may change it depending
on the work I'm doing. Plus I only get to use this under Linux.

But you are welcome to use my .vimrc to explore vim features. I've
tried to keep the .vimrc file well commented and keep my tweaks
as not-breaking-the-vim-way-of-doing-things as possible.

How to setup
------------
1. Clone this repository from GitHub to a suitable place
    e.g., $ git clone https://github.com/gaveen/vimfiles.git
2. Link the .vim and .vimrc from the clone copy to home directory
    e.g., assuming the cloned repo is ~/Apps/vimfiles
          $ ln -s ~/Apps/vimfiles/.vim ~/.vim
          $ ln -s ~/Apps/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
3. Launch vim, and update the plugins
    e.g., to upgrade vim-plug itself use :PlugUpgrade
          to install plugins first time or update them later
          :PlugUpdate


Requirements
------------
- vim and/or gvim (version 7.3 or higher)
    Package: Fedora family => vim-enhanced / vim-X11,

    if you want to fetch binaries, comment necessary line in vimrc

    Package: Fedora family => wmctrl, Debian family => wmctrl
    if your window manager supports this, uncomment necessary lines
